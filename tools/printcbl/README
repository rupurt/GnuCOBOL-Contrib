The copy books limitations has been cleared.

Limitations regarding support for replacing multi lines of a single target, e.g.,

REPLACING ==fred== BY
==joe
 albert
 henry ==

is now cleared and fully working. However note that embedded fixed comment lines
are possibly omitted depending on where they are. There is also a limit on size
if total replacing field of 248 characters. I need to define some size !

Support for replacing LEADING and TRAILING pseudo text but must be same size.

The manual discusing making changes to the programs source to suit your requirements but
as of v2.01.30, these changes are done at the start of the source in the GnuCOBOL
CDF section.
Manual has been so changed.

If you are having any issues with this version in production programs please advise.
I will not however, if you are just experimenting with COBOL code.
