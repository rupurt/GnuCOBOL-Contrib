As of and possible before, bugs have created limitations in usage:

The copy books specified after COPY must be in quotes, double or single and
it is recommended to include the extention as I am not sure of where the error
is so use COPY "foo.bar".  instead of COPY foo.bar. where .bar is the extention
name used.

There is no working support for replacing multi lines of a single target, e.g.,

REPLACING ==fred== BY ==joe==   works but

REPLACING ==fred== BY
==joe
 albert
 henry ==

does not.

Mind you I am not so sure it is valid COBOL.

Some of these errors are the result of code changes between versions and the
later, is logic issues within the COPY tables and the way it is currently set
up or not as the case may be.

The manual discusing making changes to the programs source to suit your requirements but
as of v2.01.19 most of these changes are done at the start of the source in the GnuCOBOL
CDF section.
Manual to be so changed.


I will attempt to resolve these issues as soon as I have time.
If you are having issues with this in production programs please advise.
I will not how ever, if you are just experimenting with COBOL code.
