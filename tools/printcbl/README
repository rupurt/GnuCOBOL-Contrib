As of and possible before bugs have created limitations in usage:

The copy books specified after COPY must be in quotes, double or single and
it is recommended to include the extention as I am not sure of where the error
is so use COPY "foo.bar".  instead of COPY foo.bar. where .bar is the extention
name used.

There is no working support for replacing multi lines of a single target, e.g.,

REPLACING ==fred== BY ==joe==   works but

REPLACING ==fred== BY
==joe
 albert
 henry ==

does not.

Some of these errors are the result of code changes between versions and the
later, is logic issues within the COPY tables and the way it is currently set
up or not as the case may be.

I will resolve these issues in the new year on the assumption that surgery for
my eye's works that will be done late in December. The other eye I do not have
a date for.

Trying to find errors in code is somewhat tricky when working with one 
semi-good eye that gets blurred because of cataracts. The other eye is permi-
blurred for which I am having surgery!
