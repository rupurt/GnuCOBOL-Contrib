The tree example shows you the usage of the following tree-relevant functions.

Create tree structure: 
- J-NODE, J-ADDNODE, J-TREE

Enable or disable double-click actions on tree. The default is single-click.
- J-ENABLEDOUBLECLICK, J-DISABLEDOUBLECLICK

Color settings functions:
- J-SETTREETEXTSELNAMEDCOLOR
- J-SETTREEBGSELNAMEDCOLOR
- J-SETTREEBORDERSELNAMEDCOLOR
- J-SETTREETEXTNONSELNAMEDCOLOR
- J-SETTREEBGNONSELNAMEDCOLOR
- J-SETTREETEXTSELCOLOR
- J-SETTREEBGSELCOLOR
- J-SETTREEBORDERSELCOLOR
- J-SETTREETEXTNONSELCOLOR
- J-SETTREEBGNONSELCOLOR

The example also shows how you can build a tree structure from a simple COBOL
internal table and find the selected node in the table.

TODO:
=====
The following functions are not yet implemented:
- expand / collapse tree
- get path for the selected node
- add / delete nodes dynamically
