CobolMac is a COBOL Macro Preprocessor that reads a COBOL source file prior to
processing by GnuCOBOL's cobc. It associates a macro name with a string of text.

Macros can have up to nine formal parameters. In the definition actual
parameters are supplied to replace the formal parameters when the macro is
called in the source program.

[GnuCOBOL is an open-source COBOL compiler, which translates COBOL programs to
'C' code and compiles it using GCC on multiple platforms and operating systems]

[OpenCobolIDE was used in the development of this utility. It is available from
<https://github.com/OpenCobolIDE/OpenCobolIDE>]

All code and programs are distributed under the GNU General Public License v3.
See the file COPYING for details.

NOTES
-----

As any bug fixes will be applied to the COBOL code please note that all bug
fixes should only be made to the original COBOL source code. A master copy of
the sources can be found at the sourceforge web site for GnuCOBOL in the contrib
folders located at:

  https://sourceforge.net/p/open-cobol/contrib/HEAD/tree/trunk/tools/cobolmac/

and use the "Download snapshot" function shown near the top on the right.

Please report all bugs found to the GnuCOBOL contrib forum at:

  https://sourceforge.net/p/open-cobol/discussion/contrib/

and send a copy to the author at robertw-mills@users.sf.net if urgent and/or a
show-stopper.
