GnuCOBOL Contributed Tool: CobolMac
Version: B.00.00

CobolMac is a COBOL Macro Preprocessor that reads a COBOL source file prior to
processing by GnuCOBOL's cobc. It associates a macro name with a string of text.

Macros can have up to nine formal parameters. In the definition actual
parameters are supplied to replace the formal parameters when the macro is
called in the source program.

[GnuCOBOL is an open-source COBOL compiler, which translates COBOL programs to
'C' code and compiles it using GCC on multiple platforms and operating systems]

[OpenCobolIDE was used in the development of this utility. It is available from
<https://github.com/OpenCobolIDE/OpenCobolIDE>]

All code and programs are distributed under the GNU General Public License v3.
See the file COPYING for details.

Requirements
------------

GnuCOBOL 2.0 (or greater) package installed and tested fully working. See
documentation supplied with GnuCOBOL. You MUST have run both sanity checks
created by the test procedures including within the cobol85 suite as well as the
make check procedure.

Installation
------------

Linux/Unix:

  Compile the source of cobolmac.cob with the command:

    ./comp-cobolmac.sh

  at a command prompt using any terminal program.

  Now place cobolmac in a directory that is within the PATH making sure that the
  execute flag is set (chmod +x cobolmac) although this is done within the
  script.

Mac OSX:

  Compile the COBOL source as for Linux/Unix.

  In the event this does not work, you must have installed and tested GnuCOBOL.

  Note this might not work 'as is' with Tiny Cobol or ANY other compiler. Check
  to see if the compiler supports the C$DELETE built-in system subroutine. If
  not then the s022-delete-workfiles paragraph will need modification to perform
  this function some other way (for eg. drop into a command shell and issue the
  file delete/purge commands).

Windows:

  This utility does not yet fully understand the Windows OS. It might compile
  cleanly but I currently don't have access to a Windows box to confirm this.

  If it does compile and you try to run it then the following message displayed:

    cobolmac/B.00.00 - COBOL Macro Preprocessor.

  and the utility will terminate returning an ERRORLEVEL=1

NOTES
-----

As any bug fixes will be applied to the COBOL code please note that all bug
fixes should only be made to the original COBOL source code. A master copy of
the sources can be found at the sourceforge web site for GnuCOBOL in the contrib
folders located at:

  https://sourceforge.net/p/open-cobol/contrib/HEAD/tree/trunk/tools/cobolmac/

and use the "Download snapshot" function shown near the top on the right.

Please report all bugs found to the GnuCOBOL contrib forum at:

  https://sourceforge.net/p/open-cobol/discussion/contrib/

and send a copy to the author at robertw-mills@users.sf.net if urgent and/or a
show-stopper.
