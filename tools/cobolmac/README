--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CobolMac is a COBOL source preprocessor that emulates the macro capability that
is available with the Hewlett-Packard HPe3000 COBOL II/ix compiler.

It associates a macro name with a string of text. Macros can have up to nine
formal parameters. In the definition actual parameters are supplied to replace
the formal parameters when the macro is called in the source program.

The processed source code can then be passed to a COBOL compiler to create an
executable or library module.

All code and programs are distributed under the GNU General Public License
Version 3, 29 June 2007. See the file COPYING for details.

CobolMac was developed using the following software:

  GnuCOBOL 2.0 -- An open-source COBOL compiler. It translates COBOL programs to
  'C' code and compiles it using GCC on multiple platforms.

  OpenCobolIDE -- An integrated development environment for GnuCOBOL. It is
  available from <https://github.com/OpenCobolIDE/OpenCobolIDE>]

NOTE: CobolMac has NOT been tested with OpenCobol 1.1 & GnuCOBOL 1.1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes will be applied to CobolMac Master Copy on sourceforge.

A master copy of the sources can be found at the sourceforge web site for
GnuCOBOL in the contrib folders located at:

  https://sourceforge.net/p/open-cobol/contrib/HEAD/tree/trunk/tools/cobolmac/

Use the "Download snapshot" function shown near the top on the right.

Please report all bugs found to the GnuCOBOL contrib forum at:

  https://sourceforge.net/p/open-cobol/discussion/contrib/

and send a copy to the author if urgent and/or a show-stopper.
