JOBCARDC.cob

  This is an example of a COBOL program that uses macros.

  Note: This program was written for a Hewlett-Packard e3000 system. It will NOT
        compile/run on a non-e3000 system.

JOBCARDC.inc

  Contains the macro $DEFINE commands required by JOBCARDC.cob which is loaded
  by the $INCLUDE preprocessor command. The COPY command can not be used instead
  as it is a GnuCOBOL preprocessor command and is not supported by CobolMac.

JOBCARDC.cbl

  Copy of JOBCARDC.cob after it has been preprocessed by CobolMac.

Macros.inc

  Contains the following example macros:

    %AppendCsv(Field#,CsvRecord#)

      Appends Field (with a leading comma) to CsvRecord. If Field contains a
      comma then Field is quoted before being added. Quotes within Field will be
      replaced with single-quotes.

    %JustifyRightLeadZero(InString#,OutString#)

      Right-justifies the variable passed in InString, adds leading zeros and
      returns it in the variable OutString.

    %JustifyCenter(InString#,OutString#)

      Centers the variable passed in InString and returns it in the variable
      OutString.

    %JustifyName(LastName#,FirstName#,MiddleInitial,OutString#)

      Formats the variables passed in LastName, FirstName and MiddleInit as
      'LastName, FirstName MiddleInit.' and return it in the variable OutString.

    %MoveText(Text#,Destination#,Column#)

      Move the string/variable passed in Text to the buffer named in Destination
      starting at the location specified by Column.

    %MoveNumber(Number#,Destination#,Column#,Edit#)

      Convert the number/variable passed in Number to the format specified by
      Format (available formats are listed in this macros working-storage). The
