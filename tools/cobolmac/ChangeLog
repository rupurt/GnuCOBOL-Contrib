Version B.04.00, December 2015, Robert W.Mills (robertw-mills@users.sf.net):

- Added the *--stdin* (*-i*) and *--stdout* (*-o*) options. These options are required to enable *CobolMac* to be used as a *HackEdit* preprocessor. These options are **not** supported by the alternative method used to read the command line options if the *CBL_OC_GETOPT* system routine is not available.

- Replaced the *--verbose* (*-V*) option, Include Macro Begin/End comment lines, with *--quiet* (*-q*), Suppress the Macro Begin/End comment lines.

- The *CobolMac* User Guide is now supplied in HTML format. The source text is held within the *CobolMac* source file in ReStructuredText format. It is extracted by *ocdoc* and then passed to *Doccutils* which generates the HTML file. The *Modification History*, *Planned Enhancements* and *Developer Notes* are held in external files (ChangeLog, ToDo and DevNotes) which are merged into the User Guide when *Docutils* generates it.

- Updated documentation to reflect changes.

Version B.03.01  November 2015  Robert W.Mills (robertw-mills@users.sf.net):

- Corrected bug in parameter/value substitution.

- Minor change to documentation (added 'logo').

- Minor changes to the *README* file (added 'logo' and Windows compile suggestions).

- Added 2 items to Planned Enhancements (*ToDo* file).

Version B.03.00  September 2015  Robert W.Mills (robertw-mills@users.sf.net):

- Added support for *UNIX*, *Apple Mac OS X* and *Windows* (*native*, *MinGW* and *Cygwin*).

- The built message, now includes the supported OS (*--version* & *-v* option).

- Uses an alternate method to read the command line options if the *CBL_OC_GETOPT* system routine is not available. The *--stdlib* (*-s*) option is not supported if alternate method is invoked (warning message is displayed if this case happens).

- Changed the *paragraph naming style* that caused problems with the post rev411 *GnuCOBOL* compiler.

- The *HTML* version of the documentation has been deleted.

- Updated documentation to reflect changes.

Version B.02.00  June 2015  Robert W.Mills (robertw-mills@users.sf.net):

- Implemented the *Preload standard macro definitions* planned enhancement.

- Replaced the home-grown command line option processing with calls to the *CBL_OC_GETOPT* system routine.

- Added short (single character) options to go with the existing long options.

- Updated documentation to reflect changes.

Version B.01.00  May 2015  Robert W.Mills (robertw-mills@users.sf.net):

- Removed the *stdin*/*stdout*/*stderr* redirection checks. This makes it more like other utilities in the *POSIX* world. (BTiffin request).

- Updated documentation to reflect changes.

Version B.00.00  May 2015  Robert W.Mills (robertw-mills@users.sf.net):

- Reorganised the working storage and code to make later changes easier.

- Moved the macro syntax text to the *CobolMac* Manual.

- Implemented the *$DEFINE* command. This replaced the macro text held in external files with text that is defined in-line.

- Removed the *-v*, *-m* and *-x* options as they are no longer required.

- Removed the *--macro* option as the macro syntax is now documented in the *CobolMac* Manual.

- Renamed the *-q* option to *--quiet*.

- Added the *--hardwarn* option. This causes all warnings to be treated as if they were fatal errors.

- Only two status values are returned by the program:

  0. Zero indicates that the program completed without any errors.
  1. One indicates that the program terminated in an error state.
     A tombstone will have been written to Standard Error (stderr) prior to termination and the output file, if created, will be incomplete and/or corrupt.

- Implemented the *$INCLUDE* command.

Version A.00.00  November 2014  Robert W.Mills (robertw-mills@users.sf.net):

- Changed version number in preperation for inital release.
