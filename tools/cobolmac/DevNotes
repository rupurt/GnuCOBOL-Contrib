This sections contains information that may be of assistance to the next developer working on this program.

1. Prior to release of a new version:

 - Add an entry to the Modification History (*ChangeLog* file).
 - Update the Developer Notes (*DevNotes* file), if required.
 - Increment the programs *w100-program-v-uu-ff* variable.
     *v*  = A letter indicating the VERSION.
          Increment when a MAJOR change has been made.
     *uu* = A 2-digit number indicating an UPDATE to the current VERSION.
          Set to 00 when the VERSION changes.
     *ff* = A 2-digit number indicating a FIX to the current UPDATE.
          Set to 00 when the UPDATE changes.

2. Three temporary files are used by this program. They are created in the /tmp directory and are named *cobolmac-nnnnnnnnn-n* where *nnnnnnnnn* is a 9-digit random number and *n* is either 0, 1 or 2.

  File '0' is an indexed file and is used to hold the Macro Library (macrolib).

  Files '1' and '2' are sequential files and are used to store the source code during a processing pass.

3. The *s022-delete-workfiles* paragraph will require modification/replacement if the compiler does not support the *C\$DELETE* built-in system subroutine.

4. What the program does.

  *CobolMac* will perform at least 4 'processing passes' on the source code.

  Starting with the second pass, the physical files assigned to Work Input and Work Output are swapped.

  The first pass:

    Copies the file assigned to Standard Input to Work Output.

    Records containing the following '\$' commands are dropped by the copy as they are not supported by *GnuCOBOL*:

      *\$control*, *\$copyright*, *\$if*, *\$page*, *\$set*, *\$title* and *\$version*

  The second pass:

    Copies the file assigned to Work Input to Work Output.

    Files named on *\$INCLUDE* command's are copied into Work Output at the point the *\$INCLUDE* command is found.

    Records in the *\$INCLUDE* file containing the following '\$' commands are dropped by the copy as they are not supported by *GnuCOBOL*:

      *\$control*, *\$copyright*, *\$if*, *\$page*, *\$set*, *\$title* and *\$version*

    If the *\$INCLUDE* file contains an *\$INCLUDE* command then this pass will be repeated until no more are found. This allows the use of nested *\$INCLUDE* files.

  The third pass:

    Copies the file assigned to Work Input to Work Output.

    All records identified as a macro (starts with the *\$DEFINE* command and is terminated by the macro delimiter) are extracted and written to the Macro Library.

    Records containing the following '\$' commands are dropped by the copy as they are not supported by *GnuCOBOL*:

      *\$control*, *\$copyright*, *\$if*, *\$page*, *\$set*, *\$title* and *\$version*

    The macro delimiter defaults to a '#' but this can be changed by the *\$PREPROCESSOR* command.

    Duplicate macro definitions are ignored and a comment message is inserted into Work Output.

    If the *--maclib* command line option was specified, then its at this point that the Macro Library is copied to Standard Error.

  The fourth pass (if any *\$DEFINE* commands were found in the third pass):

    Copies the file assigned to Work Input to Work Output.

    Macro *calls* are replace by their *definition*. If the *call* contains parameters then these are resolved.

    If the Macro *definition* contains another *call* then this pass will be repeated until no more are found. This allows the use of nested Macros.

  The fifth pass:

    Copies the file assigned to Work Input to Standard Output.
