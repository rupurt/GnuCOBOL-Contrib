Version A.01.00 February 2021 Robert W.Mills (rwm.cobol@gmail.com)

- This release requires that Version 3.14 (or greater) of the SQLite3 Library is installed.

- The 'cobcrun ./CobolSQLite3 --version' command will display a warning message if the current SQLite3 Library needs to be updated.

- Changed contact email address.

- Fixed DBOPEN problem discovered by Laszlo Erdos.

- Added section *1.3. SQLite3* to the User Guide documenting that SQLite is in the Public Domain.

- Added the DBBIND function.

- Added Mode 200 to DBINFO that will return a compiled SQL Statement with bind parameters expanded.

- Increased size of DBINFO-BUFFER (in CobSQLite3 Working Storage) from 80 characters to 1024 characters. This is required because of the DBINFO Mode 200 addition. Error -17 will be returned if this buffer overflows.

- Added a new section, *3. Reusing Compiled Statements*, to the User Guide documenting how the DBBIND function is used. **Note:** The number of the original section 3, and all following sections, has been increased by 1 (one).

- *CobolSQLite3* now requires use of runtime-options to generate the Copylibrary modules instead of ask if it should create them. See section *6.2.* of the User Guide for further details.

- Added a third Example/Test Program. Test-3.cob is a modified copy of Test-1.cob that demonstrates the DBBIND function and Reusing Compiled Statements.

- Updated the User Guide to document the changes made.

Version X.03.00 [BETA] September 2017 Robert W.Mills (CobolMac@btinternet.com)

It is extracted by *ocdoc* and then passed to *Doccutils* which generates the HTML file. The *Modification History* and *Planned Enhancements* are held in external files (ChangeLog and ToDo) which are merged into the User Guide when *Docutils* generates it.

- Added the DBGET function (replaces the DBGETSTR and DBGETINT functions).
