Version X.03.00 [BETA] September 2017 Robert W.Mills (CobolMac@btinternet.com)

The *Modification History* and *Planned Enhancements* are held in external files (ChangeLog and ToDo) which are merged into the User Guide when *Docutils* generates it.

- Added the DBGET function (replaces the DBGETSTR and DBGETINT functions).
