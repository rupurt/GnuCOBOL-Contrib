*** GnuCOBOL TEXT USER INTERFACE (TUI) TOOLS COLLECTON ***

GnuCOBOL is a great product but it needs functions for an easy management of text user interfaces. 
Usual objects like: bar menu, drop-down menu, buttons, message boxes, and so on.
Of course, these functions have to be developed with GnuCOBOL itself. 
And, for COBOL programmers, it has to be just PURE COBOL (!), without C wrappers (!).
This is my contribution to the project.
You will find COBOL programs you can "CALL" to manage menus, display box, buttons ...
You can choose: position, size, colors, borders, shadows, titles, 3D effect ...

You'll find commented source files. 
Documentation of parameters are inside the copybooks.
I also have prepared demo programs to demonstrate how to "call" the programs and some of the main effects.
I have called those modules "GnuCOBOL TT = TUI (TEXT USER INTERFACE) TOOLS COLLECTION"
The sources have been compiled with GnuCOBOL 2.0.

I used the Arnold Trembley pack for Windows MinGW (download it , unpack it, and the compiler is ready to use !). 
I used OpendCOBOLIDE, another very very nice product that I reccomend.
The development of programs has been on a Windows 10 64bit machine.

Please, let me know if you have any suggestion to improve the functions.
Your suggestions will be very useful and welcome.

The collection is made by folllowing programs (I will upload other modules in the future)

single/double/custom borders, 3D effect and so on. This funcion is mainly used by other modules.
