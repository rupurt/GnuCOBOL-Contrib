*** GnuCOBOL TUI (TEXT USER INTERFACE) TOOLS AND UTILITIES COLLECTON ***

In this folder you can find GnuCOBOL TUI TOOLS (GC01xxxxxx to GC98xxxxxx) 
and GnuCOBOL Utilities (GC99xxxxxx) 

Although the textual interfaces are often replaced by graphical interfaces, 
a good compiler have to allow to develop complete applications in an easy way 
even with textual user interfaces.
GnuCOBOL have to generate applications with those objects that allow a classical and 
friendly user interface like other programming languages on windows and unix platform.
This is a collection of GnuCOBOL programs useful to this purpose.
It includes programs to manage classical TUI objects like: dropdown menus, 
multiple-choice Buttons, buttons of YES NO type, calendar to pickup a date, 
on-screen messages, boxes, checkboxes, radiobuttons, listview, calculator, and so on.
All programs have been developed exclusively using GnuCOBOL 
(Pure COBOL with also call to "C" funtions but without C wrappers).
They are COBOL programs you can "CALL" from your source 
to manage dropdown menus, display box, buttons , radiobuttons, ... 
You can choose: position, size, colors, borders, shadows, titles, 3D effect ...
Source files are well commented. Documentation of parameters are inside the copybooks.
Each TUI-TOOL have a corresponding demo programs to show how to use the TOOL.
The sources have been compiled with GnuCOBOL 2.0.
Let me know if you have any suggestion or idea to improve/extend the tools.
Your suggestions will be very useful and welcome.

The collection has folllowing programs (other modules will follow in the future)

GC01BOX.COB - call it to display boxes on screen, you can specify back/fore colors, 
size, position, single/double/custom borders, 3D effect and so on. 
This function is mainly developed to be used by other following tools.

GC02BOXMEX.COB - call it to display messages on screen, you can specify back/fore 
colors, size, position, single/double/custom borders, 3D effect and so on.

GC03YESNO.COB - it display a BOX with a simple message and two big buttons 
YES & NO on screen, you can specify back/fore colors, size, position, and so on.

GC09BUTTONS.COB - call it to display buttons on screen, you can specify number of 
buttons,back/fore colors, size, position, text of buttons and so on.

GC13CHEKBOX.COB - call it to display checkbox items (switches) on screen, you can 
specify number of items, back/fore colors, size, position, symbol , brackets and so on.

GC18RADIOBUTTON.COB - call it to display rediobutton items (options) on screen, you can 
specify number of items, back/fore colors, size, position, symbol , brackets and so on.

GC21MENU.COB - (obsolete) call it to display menus on screen, you can manage bar menu, 
dropdown menu, specify number of items, text and length of items, back/fore colors, 
position, messages associated to menu items, and so on.
GC22MENU.COB - the new version of GC21MENU implementing hot keys. It replaces GC21MENU.COB.
It use "call getch" instead of ACCEPT OMITTED to detect letter keypress from user.

GC26LISTVIEW.COB - call it to display a window with an item list on screen. 
The user can browse vertical and horizontal the list and select one of the items.

GC51CALYEAR.COB - call it to display a one year calendar on screen.
User can browse days, months and years to pick-up a date.

GC52 COLORPICKER - Displays a colorpair map (back / foreground colors combination) 
Let the user to browse on it and pick up a color pair 

GC53CALENDAR.COB - call it to display a calendar on screen. three months on each row 
User can scroll months and years to display month / year calendar.

GC54FILEPICKER.COB - call it to display a window with a File list on screen.  
The user can browse vertical and horizontal the file list and select one of the items.
The user can also select and navigate Up and Down on directories 

GC56DATEPICKER.COB - call it to display a one month calendar (regular or small size)
You can specify starting date, back/fore colors, size, position, single/double/custom 
borders, 3D effect and so on. User can browse days, months and years to pick-up a date.

GC58SAVERCLOCK.COB - call it to display a screen saver with a big clock and a scrolling 
string. the big clock will move randomly on screen. you can specify back/fore colors, 
size, position, single/double/custom borders, 3D effect and so on.

GC61CALC.COB - call it to display a simple pocket calculator on screen.
The user can enter numbers and operators. Returns the result of calculation to the caller .

GC71CRUDExxxx.COB - A complete "CRUDE" (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application. 
It shows you how to create, read(browse), update, delete indexed file records. 
It is a real application (it manage a "master data" file) showing also:
- how to accept and check alphanumeric fields on screen, 
- how to accept and check numeric fields with sign and decimals,
- how to pickup a date, 
- how to use indexed files with alternate keys, 
- how to display context sensitive help information (from GC74HELPxxx TOOL). 
Copying and modifying this programs you can develop a lot of other type of applications. 

GC74HELPxxxx.COB - A "HELP" system. You can write text help files , load it on indexed files.
List the indexde file , access to this HELP messages from any CRUDE application.

GC99BANNER.COB - accept a string and print that string in big character.
Useful to print a banner page for your reports.

GC99COPYGEN.COB - Copy generator for cobol programs that write reports. How to use it:
1. create a text file with the graphical layout of the report. 
Set all constants and variables. 
Use the $ symbol when you want a PIC X field, use the # symbol when you want a PIC 9. 
For a better graphical representation of the report you can also insert 
blank lines or also repeated rows equal to previous lines.
2. run the program GC99COPYGEN to read the TXT file with the report layout 
It will create the corresponding Copy COBOL in a .CPY text file. 
The program will skip blank lines and will skip rows equals to each other, 
eg. rows with same fields, will produce a single line in the copy.
3. the Copy COBOL obtained should be used directly in the COBOL program 
that will produce the report, or you can change it before, 
to enhance the Copy COBOL example for a better the editing Picture 
of individual fields directly in the copy.
