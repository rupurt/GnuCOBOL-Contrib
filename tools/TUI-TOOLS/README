*** GCTTC: GnuCOBOL TUI (TEXT USER INTERFACE) TOOLS AND UTILITIES COLLECTON ***

In this folder you can find COBOL TUI TOOLS (GC01xxxxxx to GC98xxxxxx) and COBOL Utilities (GC99xxxxxx) 

Although the textual interfaces are now replaced by graphical interfaces, a good compiler 
must allow to develop complete applications in an easy way even with textual user interfaces.

GnuCOBOL have to generate applications with those objects that allow a classical and friendly
user interface like other programming languages on windows and unix platform.

GCTTC is a collection of COBOL modules (functions/sources) useful for this purpose.
GCTTC includes modules to manage classical TUI objects like: dropdown menus, 
multiple-choice Buttons, buttons of YES NO type, calendar for selecting a date, 
on-screen messages, boxes, check boxes, radio buttons, and so on.

All modules have been developed exclusively using GnuCOBOL 
(Pure COBOL with also call to "C" funtions but no C wrappers).

They are COBOL programs you can "CALL" from your source to manage dropdown menus, 
display box, buttons ... 
You can choose: position, size, colors, borders, shadows, titles, 3D effect ...

All source files are well commented. Documentation of parameters are inside the copybooks.
Each TOOL have corresponding demo programs to demonstrate how to "call" the TOOL 
and some of other main effects.
Those modules are called "GnuCOBOL TTC = TUI (TEXT USER INTERFACE) TOOLS COLLECTION"
The sources have been compiled with GnuCOBOL 2.0.

The naming convention of tools is: GnnXXXXXX. 
Where nn = a code that identifies the function and xxxxx = a brief description of the function.
For each tools there is a COBOL source and a COPY book in which there are 
all parameters of the function and parameter to be returned to the caller.

Let me know if you have any suggestion or idea to improve/extend the tools.
Your suggestions will be very useful and welcome.

The collection is made by folllowing programs (other modules will follow in the future)

GC01BOX.COB 
call it to display boxes on screen, you can specify back/fore colors, size, position, 
single/double/custom borders, 3D effect and so on. 
This function is mainly developed to be used by other following tools.

GC02BOXMEX.COB 
call it to display messages on screen, you can specify back/fore colors, size, position, 
single/double/custom borders, 3D effect and so on.

GC03YESNO.COB 
call it to display a BOX with a simple message and two big buttons YES & NO on screen, 
you can specify back/fore colors, size, position, and so on.

GC09BUTTONS.COB 
call it to display buttons on screen, you can specify number of buttons, 
back/fore colors, size, position, text of buttons and so on.

GC13CHEKBOX.COB 
call it to display checkbox items (switches) on screen, you can specify number of items, 
back/fore colors, size, position, symbol , brackets and so on.

GC21MENU.COB 
call it to display menus on screen, you can manage bar menu, dropdown menu, 
specify number of items, text and length of items, back/fore colors, position, 
messages associated to menu items, and so on.

GC22MENU.COB 
a new version of GC21MENU implementing hot keys.
It use "call getch" instead of ACCEPT OMITTED to detect normal letter keypress from user.

GC51CALYEAR.COB
call it to display a one year calendar on screen.
User can browse days, months and years to pick-up a date.

GC53CALENDAR.COB
call it to display a calendar on screen. three months on on erow 
User can scroll months and years 

GC56DATEPICKER.COB
call it to display a one month calendar (regular or small size)
you can specify starting date, back/fore colors, size, position, 
single/double/custom borders, 3D effect and so on.
User can browse days, months and years to pick-up a date.

GC58SAVERCLOCK.COB
call it to display a screen saver with a big clock and a scrolling string.
the big clock will move randomly on screen.
you can specify back/fore colors, size, position, single/double/custom borders, 
3D effect and so on.

GC71CRUDExxxx.COB
A "CRUDE" application. It shows hot to create, read(browse), update, delete indexed file records.
This is a real application showing how to accept fields on screen, numeric fileds (with sign and decimals)
How to pickup a date. How to use indexed files with alternate index.
How to display context sensitive help information (from GC74HELPxxx TOOL)
Copying and modifying this programs you can develop a lot of other type of applications. 

GC74HELPxxxx.COB
A "HELP" system. You can write text help files , load it on indexed files.
List the indexde file , access to this HELP messages from any CRUDE application.


GC99COPYGEN.COB
Copy generator for cobol programs that write reports,
How to use it:
1. create a text file with the layout of the report. Set all constants and variables. 
Use the $ symbol when you want a PIC X field,use the # symbol when you want a PIC 9. 
For a better graphical representation of the report you can also insert 
blank lines or also rows repeated and identical to previous lines.
2. run the program GC99COPYGEN that reads the TXT file with the report layout 
and creates the corresponding Copy COBOL in a .CPY text file. 
The program will skip blank lines and will skip rows equals to each other, 
eg. with the same fields, produces a single line in the copy.
3. the Copy COBOL obtained should be used directly in the COBOL program 
that will produce the report, or you can change it before, 
to enhance the Copy COBOL example for a better the editing Picture 
of individual fields directly in the copy.
