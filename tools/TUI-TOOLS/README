GnuCOBOL TT TEXT USER INTERFACE (TUI) TOOLS
GnuCOBOL is a great product but at the moment it has not yet available functions for an easy management of text user interfaces. You need usual objects like: boxes, message boxes, buttons, dropdown menus, listview, checkbox, and so on.
Of course, these functions have to be developed with GnuCOBOL. 
And, for COBOL programmers, it has to be just pure COBOL (!), no C wrappers (!).
This is my contribution to the project.
You will find objects like callable function to display a box. 
With management of: position, size, colors, borders, shadows, titles, 3D effect ...
This box object will be the basis for the creation of next, more complex objects.
You'll find well-commented source file. Documentation of parameters are inside the copy file.
I also have prepared demo programs to demonstrate how to "call" the programs and some of the main effects.
I will call these modules "GnuCOBOL TT = TUI (TEXT USER INTERFACE) TOOLS"
The sources have been compiled with GnuCOBOL 2.0.

I used the Arnold Trembley pack for Windows MinGW (download it , unpack it, and the compiler is ready to use !). 
I used OpendCOBOL IDE, another very very nice product that I reccomend.
The development of programs has been on a Windows 10 64bit machine.
Please, let me know if you have any suggestions to improve the functions.
Your suggestion will be very useful and welcome.

The collection is made by folllowing programs (I will upload other modules in the future)

GC01BOX.COB 
call it to display boxes on screen, you can specify back/fore colors, size, position, 
single/double/custom borders, 3D effect and so on.

GC09BUTTONS.COB

GC56DATEPICKER.COB
