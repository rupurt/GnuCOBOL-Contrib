* documentation
* test with MacOS
* set options within BPE
* allow a path list for modules (current limit: 1)
* read module path from COB_LIBRARY_PATH
* libcob_path does not work on GNU/Linux
* non-clean exit when
    - paths.ini not found
    - libcob not found on GNU/Linux (need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
    - loading a module not compiled with GnuCOBOL debugging branch (File "bpedit\backend\cwrapper.py", line 19, in get_module_line_count -> AttributeError: function 'get_linecount_HelloWorld' not found)
    - loading a module failed because libcob could not be found or because it is not the right one
