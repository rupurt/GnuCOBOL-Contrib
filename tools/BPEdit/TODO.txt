
 ~~~ BPE - Breakpoint Editor ~~~ ToDo ~~~

* popup window to show the current breakpoints and directly go there (open module if necessary)
  on double-click
* documentation
* test with MacOS
* set options within BPE, likely with QSettings (Note: "eats" comments)
* allow a path list for modules (current limit: 1)
* read module path from COB_LIBRARY_PATH
* libcob_path does not work on GNU/Linux (need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
* better check if libcob exists and has debugging functions in
