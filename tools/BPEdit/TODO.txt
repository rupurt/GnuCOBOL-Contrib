
 ~~~ BPE - Breakpoint Editor ~~~ ToDo ~~~

* packaging does not work correctly yet
* modules (dll/so) should be loaded when chosen from and directly unloaded,
  BPE currently still holds the file handle to the module, even if a different module is chosen!
* option to reload module would be nice (it works by switching the module temporary)
* popup window to show the current breakpoints and directly go there (open module if necessary)
  on double-click
* documentation
* test with MacOS
* set options within BPE
* allow a path list for modules (current limit: 1)
* read module path from COB_LIBRARY_PATH
* libcob_path does not work on GNU/Linux
* non-clean exit when
    - paths.ini not found
    - libcob not found on GNU/Linux (need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
    - loading a module not compiled with GnuCOBOL debugging branch (File "bpedit\backend\cwrapper.py", line 19, in get_module_line_count -> AttributeError: function 'get_linecount_HelloWorld' not found)
    - loading a module failed because libcob could not be found or because it is not the right one
