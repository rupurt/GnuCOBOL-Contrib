       (v2.02.03)   Added extra tests for line starting with >>SOURCE as a sample
                    program this started in cc9 by using TRIM to strip out
                    leading spaces in zz100-Get-A-Source-Record as previous
                    version was missing the '>>SOURCE' and failing with msg2.
                    Needless to say cobc accepts this incorrectly placed
                    >>SOURCE error.

2019-06-24  Vincent B Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
       (v2.02.02)   Added print line o/p for display in bb100-scan4-colon
                    for testing a suspected error. Also one for XTERNAL processing
                    Ongoing.

2019-05-13  Vincent B Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
       (v2.02.01)   Released.
                    Bug fix for page number > 127 using bin-char instead of long
                    Support for user supplied names for data, section, paragraph
                    and called modules up to 63 chars.
                    Technically names for program and modules can also be up to
                    that size but most system cannot support it due to preset
                    limitations within *nix.
                    Usage of long program / module names will result in
                    truncation of one or both in listing header lines,
                    Blame size of A4 and Letter paper and ink jets, now if we
                    were still using matrix or line printer the problem would
                    not arise.

2019-03-11  Vincent B Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
       (v2.01.02)   Released.
                    Support for replacing LEADING and TRAILING pseudo text but
                    must be same size as inspect replacing is used.


2019-03-10  Vincent B Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
       (v2.01.01)   Released.
                    All reported and found bugs cleared. modules Codebase merged
                    with printcbl. Manual updated.

2019-02-26  Vincent B Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
       (v1.99.40)
           BUGS: 1  cobxref producing ZZ110-GAWCH messages for fixed and free.
                 2  cobxref in xref showing all CALLS are USER - case issue ?
                    To find problems.
                    Both found and fixed.

                    Added support for:
                 A. FUNCTION-ID in place of PROGRAM-ID but does the same thing.
                 B. At start use base source file name for listings until
                    Program / function ID found.
                 C. Reporting multi programs by adding to sorting records the
                    current active program name. Reporting is still the same.
                    New parameter function to turn on block xrefs for nested
                    program sources.
                    activated by param -AX  ----- NOT YET ADDED.
                 D. In place of testing mode support output of generated
                    source file same as cobc -E but without comment or blank lines
                    to stop using test mode when wishing to look at the actual
                    source that cobxref processes - Useful during testing
                    available with new program option parameter -E.

                    Updated version number to v2.01.00.

2019-02-26  Vincent B Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v1.99.38  * Lots of changes to modules printcbl (and the program version)
       (v2.01.29)   For Printcbl module - Replacing clause
                    Does NOT now change comments (In Cobc it does
                    see the listings via the -T | -t option.)
                    In fact comments are totally ignored.
                    When replacing text without pseudo option it
                    will only replacing text with space before and after
                    and not any text within text as only pseudo can.
                    Literals are changed if the are exactly the same
                    so "abcde" by "efg" will not work if source is
                    "Abcd" etc. Literals MUST be an exact match therefore
                    a continuation literal must be separately specified for
                    replacements.
                    So far all testing with FREE format sources only.
                    Various other small bugs fixed caused by comments.
                    Improved test & checks to verify and report if not
                    that all replacing sources are found in copy library
                    with a warning line in listing and or new source file
                    indicating if not (Msg29).
                    Fixed bug on replace - forgot to convert search texts to
                    upper-case before comparing like for like in inspect.
                    Dumb error.  Now working. Not using leading/trailing
                    as cannot work out how to support them.
                    COPY using Psuedo text replace all instances within a line
                    so replacing ==ABC== by ==DEF== does all instances of 'ABC'.
                    The other two variations literals or words just does it once
                    per line.
                    NEXT - Sort out funnies with copy lib file names as only working
                    if using quotes.
                    return-code not set before entry to zz400-Check-File-Exists
                    so it was not being processed.
                    ReTesting for Fixed format now working as well as FREE.

2019-02-14  Vincent B Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>


  GRL    1.00.04  * New parameter -VT to turn OFF messages for updating
  cobx        37    reserved word type tables in GRL (get-reserved-lists).

              36  * Bugs fixes up to COPY verb processing
                    within printcbl module and generating listings and xref.
                    Issues with COPY replacing - a mess with poor to non existent
                    replacing for free format.
                    Replacing works using vars by var-2 in and out of order
                    of source but ==xxx== etc is not working.
                    Fixed not yet tested.

              34  * Found-copy not set to zero in after o/p

        v1.99.33  * Testing starting on COPY verb processing.
                    FREE format 1st. - Broken producing *>>>A at and next COPY verb!!

        v1.99.30  * More CALL coding no reporting yet. Testing.
              32  * Testing completed for Free format only so far.

 >>               * Testing for fixed format source still to do!
 >>>              * Likewise testing for COPY verbs free and fixed.

        v1.99.29  * Changed code to match up with o/p when using source file
                    created by cobc --save-temps as proven with test flag on
                    and creating file name.src post space, other waste removal.
                    It might be faster but there again may well be slower!
                    Handles nested programs better.
                  * Renamed message names throughout with
                    msg1 - 10, 18 - 19 for cobxref - updated.,
                    msg11 - 16         for get-reserved - updated,
                    msg21 - 31         for printcbl
                  * Created new System table in cobxref
                  * Started coding for CALL reporting. early days.
                    Found reason for ba20: msg4 error sometimes
                    Hopefully now fixed (Proc Div tested but retest skipped).

2019-01-28  Vincent B Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v1.99.24  * New Parameter for FREE or FIXED
                  * Inserted modified printcbl to handle COPY processing
                    creating a new file used as i/p to xref with ext as .pro
                    A Lot, Lot easier and any bugs found in copy
                    processing can be copied over to the full printcbl
                    program - therefore doing two sets of testing in
                    one hit...
                    When completed and tested version upgraded
                    to v2.00.24.
                  * Added module ID in Xref heading if not same as
                    main program name - supports nested modules cleaner.
                  * Reduced source record size from 1024 to 256.
                  * Start support for fixed format sources.
                  * Support for quoted literals starting with H,X,Z
                    in zz110-Get-A-Word-Unstring and
                    in zz110-Get-A-Word-Literal.
                  * Ignore all CDF verbs starting with >> as next words
                    not in reserved word lists. zz110-Get-A-Word-Unstring.
                    also not done in the internal xref thing.

2018-10-15  Vincent B Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v1.01.23  * Replace any reference to Open Cobol to GnuCOBOL.
                  * Renamed/Renumbered zz310 & zz400 routines to
                     zz220 & zz240 so that the copybook routines
                     can go back in without changes - Right!
        v1.01.24  * Restore copy lib processing code from routines starting
                    zz300. init taking it from printcbl and comparing with
                    the profiler code base. Updated copyright notices.

2018-09-19  Vincent B Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v1.01.22  * Increased additional reserved lists from 1024 to 2048.

2017-03-23  Vincent B Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v1.01.21  * Removed XREF list code (01.20).
                  * Removed test code for printer error/s in (cobc).
                  * Removed (see 01.19) lines printed no longer needed.
                  * Added in heads year CC and changed format if
                    LC-TIME = en_GB = Great Britain format,
                              en_US = U.S.A format,
                     else defaults to unix format (ccyy/mm/dd).
                    More can be added if details known.
                    Must be a way of doing this inside Cobol using
                    GC compiler but do not know how ?
                    Problems still exist in cobc at 1481 regarding listing
                    source where more than one program is in src file and
                    likewise for only one program where xref occurs before the
                    source list.

2017-03-22  Vincent B Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v1.01.20  * Added new lpr file for XREF where data taken from the
                    Normal printfile that is still held by cobc.
                    This is more test code than anything else.

2016-08-16  Vincent B Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v1.01.19  * Add extra display for total lines printed. Still tracing
                    for problem via cobc call with missing report.
                  * Moved code from get-reserved-lists into cobxref.

2016-07-06  Vincent B Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v1.01.17  * Added test if listing file exists is it the same time or
                    within 1 minute if so treat as -A applied.
                  * Added display of input rec count to help test o/p of
                    cobc with -T | -t.
                  * Rem'd out the DELETE of the temp sort files to help
                    in any error diagnostics - (around line 1612).
                    The records are only 40 bytes per variable.
                  * Clear bug where sort file receiving blank data names
                    not sure why it is happening though ??

        v1.01.18  * Test for FS-Reply non zero when printing 1st two headings
                    to see if cobc not closing print file before calling
                    cobxref. No definative answer and still happening.

2016-07-05  Vincent B Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v1.01.16  * Add param option -A to append listing to existing file.
                    Introduced with the new compiler option -T | -t
                    which now creates a sensible program listing.

2014-11-08  Vincent B Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v1.01.15  * Fix bug where option -G still produced all other reports.
                    Now it just produces a all in 1 report similar to MF & IBM.
                    **********************************************************
                    Must get round to performing reports one at a time instead
                    of full-through coding.

2014-11-05  Vincent B Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v1.01.14  * Fix bug where multi braces inside or right of : e.g.,
                    fred)anything:anything)

        v1.01.13  * Replaced when compiled with cobxref name and version.
                    Ensure that all print sections check linecount > 59.

        v1.01.12  * Improved error msg bb053 with more info and
	            outputing blank lines at req. Rob. Mills

2014-11-01  Vincent B Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
	v1.01.11  * Last version before adding in COPY library processing so
	            that the program can be fully used outside cobc control as
	            the source file provided by cobc has been converted to short
	            free format with blanks in place of comment lines prior to
	            processing through the parser etc. Code will come from
	            current printcbl (v2.01.14).
	            Clear bug regarding tabs so it can be revoked outside cobc.
	            Clean up placement of headings on listings after page 1 so
	            that they sit at the start of a line and not imbedded by
	            previous line with a ^L (control L) char and users uses less
	            or an editor to look at the output.

        v1.01.10  * Clearing aa047 bug caused by bad 'if numeric' test against
                    a pic 9 field changed to a test against pic x vales 0 - 9.
                  * Added/uncommented code for new headings every 60 lines.

2014-07-13  Vincent B Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v1.01.09  * Added error msg # to error messages.
                  * Added GNU to compiler name for both modules in notices.
                  * Added message numbers Msg11 - Msg14 to get-reserved-lists
                    likewise added Msg17 to cobxref - missed it:(
                  * Now trying to trace msg16 aa047 bug that is happening
                    on get-reserved and cobxref which may have started with
        v1.01.07.   More looking needed.

2011-10-02  Vincent B Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v1.01.08  * Global-Current-Level to use 99 instead of high-values for GC v2.0
                    No I have no idea why I should need to as highest value on a
                    numeric field is 99.

2010-09-26  Vincent B Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v1.01.07  * Changed zz170 to make it tighter with less processing steps
                    as original was getting hit hard as seen using the profiler.
                  * Clean up date in copyright display to include current year.
                  * Added module get-reserved-lists called by cobxref at start
                    that calls the currently installed cobc to get the intrinsic
                    and reserved words and totally update the 2 tables prior to
                    sorting them (just in case the OC programmer did not).
                  * Code takes flow through cobc using -X parameter so if used
                    standalone it MUST use the source code file filename.i
                    created through cobc --save-temps which has all copy
                    verbs preprocessed & comment lines replaced by blank lines.
                  * Program default will now list the source code prior to the
                    cross reference listing, -R now stops it.

2009-02-21  Vincent B Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v1.01.04  * Added support for .pre via cobc with other very minor
                    changes and upgraded version to v1 prior to incl into cobc.
                  * fixed bug with blogs(nocare) in Screen or Report Sec.

        v1.00.03  * Created same table in get-reserved for
                  * System functions with get-reserved updating them
                  * Fix some bugs causing possible blank data in table/s.
                  * Add extra reserved works from Obsolete words and
                    internal registers.
                  * Not using new table yet.

2009-02-14  Vincent B Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v0.95.75  * fixed bugs regarding Special-names and file-control
                    where one or both may not be present. Extra suport
                    for Report writer but note that user names will be shown
                    where user has declared it ie, Select, FD, RD, WS etc
                    This could show duplicate entries for ones in FD, RD & WS
                    but that seems to help in analysis.
                    Code now in free format and some if statements now have
                    end-ifs as code changes but only ones where logic flow
                    might be a problem to keep it easy to read. There is many
                    programming languages that have periods '.', ':', and/or';'
                    to terminate lines and that works fine.
                     Cobol is no exception.
                    Consider bring back all code for COPY verbs in case
                    xref is used stand alone for other compilers in
                    release v0.96.00 which may well be the next release subject

        v0.95.68  * Now support for user defined words in WS areas not
                    covered ie Report Writer (ba040 - ba049) ie:

                    fore|background||control|size|key [is]
                    thru|through & start|length [of]
                    footings [at]  &  top|bottom
                    and any other

2009-02-12  Vincent B Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v0.95.67  * Added support for special-names Currency sign is
                    as needed for test at ws on PIC.
                    Also added extra tests here for other leading chars.
                    Hopefully will now clear cobol85 tests in NC.
                    Rewritten procedure processing code for more support
                    in (hjhkjhkjh) etc including colon and lits etc.
                    Additional coding for listings.
                    This version clears All cobol85 tests without failure.
                    Added 3 additional non-reserved reserved words to lists
                    so that they are not reported on.

2009-01-31  Vincent B Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v0.95.44  * Restored -G param Group listings to make it easier to
                    compare listings from xref with MF or IBM as they are
                    more basic.

2009-01-20  Vincent B Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v0.95.43  * extra sub verbs in screen section added more needed
                  * ditto in ws sub verbs see DONE.
                  * Added to function table: CONCATENATE, SUBSTITUTE/-CASE

2009-01-14  Vincent B Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v0.95.41  * Support for free format source lines up to 255 chars
                  * Support for Cobol word sizes of 31 chars and allowance
                    for this to be increased without major problems
                    both in compliance for INCITS PL 22.4 20xx

2009-01-13  Vincent B Coen <vbcoen@btconnect.com>
        v0.95.40  * Cleared bugs related to ws fields used in proc. with
                    )) after, ditto the (1 1 1) format. These bugs traced
                    after putting a large m/f program through OC and xref
                    which needless to say fails in TC
                  * Temporary working files (Partn.tmp) now stored in
                    TMPDIR or TMP or TEMP or if not present /tmp directory.
                    This works for Linux and should for WinDoz as TMP
                    is defined at least at the system level. Also Path
                    name limits increased to 1024 chars for working files.
                  * Other changes made to cater for cobxref being called by
                    cobc.

                    SUBSTITUTE and some new functions
                  * System reserved names are deliberately omitted so
                    that they appear in xref listings.

                  * Added version/build nos plus build date to headings & help.

                  * Code for producing 01 record layout sizing but should it be
		    added?
