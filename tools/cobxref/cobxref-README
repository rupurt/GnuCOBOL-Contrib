This README is superceded by the PDF manual and this includes all changes for
version v2.03.04 that runs under Windows, *nix, Linux etc with the GnuCOBOL
compiler.

This version supports both fixed and free format Cobol source files creating
Cobol cross references listings.

This version supports user supplied names for data, section, paragraph,
program and modules to 63 characters if using the latest GnuCobol code base v3.

It has been tested against production sources - well in excess of
1000 programs as well as various test source programs.

I have not tested it with Windows.

Read the Changelog for latest updates and bug fixes.

This project area (cobxref) also has the current version for
IBM MVS Ansi Cobol at:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/cobxref/IBM-MVS-38J-Ansi-Cobol/ cobxref-IBM-MVS-38J-Ansi-Cobol

but it does not provide support for COPY libraries due to no demand.
In any event such would require adding extra supporting modules into MVS to
allow Cobol programs access to the PDS file system.

Please report all bugs found for the GnuCOBOL version to the GNUCobol contrib
forum at https://sourceforge.net/p/gnucobol/discussion/contrib/ and send a
copy to the author at vbcoen@gmail.com if urgent or a showstopper.

Bugs for the IBM version direct to author at vbcoen@gmail.com with a subject
of MVS bug.
