			       CobXRef
		http://sourceforge.net/projects/cobxref/


CobXRef is a Cobol cross reference tool that reads a Cobol source file as output
by GNUCobol's cobc with the -X (or -E or -save-temps) parameter/s supplied and
produces a file suitable for printing 'as is' that contains all variables,
procedure paragraphs and section names referenced where they are defined
as well as where they are used throughout the program or module as well as
lists of unreferenced data names and paragraph & section names.

Usage using other than -X can/will produce unexspected and unwanted results so
only use the -X or -Xref option. 

As of r1482 of the GNUCobol compiler sources using -X and -T will produce both
a source listing and the cross reference listing in the same file.
 
If used as a stand alone program it will precede the cross reference report
by a listing of the original source. Note that version 1.2 will include the
code from printcbl which takes in the copy books when used by any COPY verbs
in the source to a depth of 9. [ This is not available as of 2017/03/24 ].

NOTE that if run via cobc using -X, source listing will NOT precede the cross
reference listing as the source file from cobc will have all comment line
replaced with blank lines and all source moved to the left with formatting
spaces replaced by just one space for use with the compilers parser.

As this format looks like a dogs dinner, the default operation is to only
produce a cross reference listing without the source listed as cobc will call
cobxref with the paramater -R (No source listing) see next:

The new compiler (v2.0) options of -T | -t can now allow the XRef listing to
be appending to an existing listing file (source filename.lst) with the use
of the -X option in CobXRef (1.01.21). However there are still bugs in cobc as
at r1482.

WARNING:  The program uses the field Compiler-Line-Cnt to hold the default
cobc page size of 55 so if you change the one in cobc sources etc change this
field in cobxref to match.

It will read a source file containing a standalone program or many program &
modules providing they confirm to the Cobol standard in the same way that
GNUCobol does.

Cobxref should only be run against source code that has been processed by cobc
without errors and optionally without warnings when using cobc param -W.

[GNUCOBOL is an open-source COBOL compiler, which translates COBOL programs to
C code and compiles it using GCC on multiple platforms and operating systems]

Do NOT use this version as a standalone tool with a standard source file, it has been changed to work directly with cobc - the GnuCobol compiler.

All code and programs are distributed under the GNU General Public License v3.
See COPYING for details.


Requirements
============

GNUCobol v2 package installed and tested fully working.

See documentation supplied with GNUCobol.
You MUST have run both sanity checks created by the test procedures including
within the cobol85 suite as well as the make check procedure.

Installation
============

Linux/Unix:
Compile the source of cobxref.cbl which includes get-reserved-lists with the
GNUCobol compiler cobc using the supplied shell script comp-cobxref.sh with
the command ./comp-cobxref.sh at a command prompt using any terminal program.

Now place cobxref in a directory that is within the PATH making sure that the
execute flag is set (chmod +x cobxref) although this is done within the script.

Mac OSX:
Compile the Cobol source as for Linux/Unix.

In the event this does not work, you must have installed and tested GNUCobol.
Note this will NOT work 'as is' with Tiny Cobol or ANY other compiler.

NOTES:
*****

You must compile using an up to date version of GNUCobol (c) but not less
than version v2.x. Current testing is with v2.0.

Note that the CobXRef directory will contain just updated sources over
the archived file e.g., cobxref-1.01.15.zip

A master copy of the sources can be found at the sourceforge web site

Please report all bugs found to the GNUCobol contrib forum at

and send a copy to the author at vbcoen@gmail.com if urgent/showstopper.

Bugs for the IBM version direct to author at vbcoen@gmail.com with a subject of
