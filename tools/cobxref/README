			       CobXRef
		http://sourceforge.net/projects/cobxref/


CobXRef is a Cobol cross reference tool that reads a Cobol source file as output
by GNUCobol's cobc with the -X (or -E or -save-temps) parameter/s supplied and
produces a file suitable for printing 'as is' that contains all variables,
procedure paragraphs and section names referenced where they are defined
as well as where they are used throughout the program or module as well as
a lists of unreferenced data names and paragraph & section names.

if used as a stand alone program it will preceded the cross reference report
by a listing of the original source. Note that version 1.2 (hopefully will be
released late November 2014) will include the code from printcbl which takes
in the copy books when used by any COPY verbs in the source to a depth of 9.

NOTE that if run via cobc using -X, source listing will NOT precede the cross
reference listing as the source file from cobc will have all comment line
replaced with blank lines and all source moved to the left with formatting
spaces replaced by just one space for use with the compilers parser.

As this format looks like a dogs dinner, the default operation is to only
produce a cross reference listing without the source listed as cobc will call
cobxref with the paramater -R (No source listing).

It will read a source file containing a standalone program or many program &
modules providing they confirm to the Cobol standard in the same way that
GNUCobol does.

Cobxref should only be run against source code that has been processed by cobc
without errors and optionally without warnings when using cobc param -W.

Requirements
============

GNUCobol package installed and tested fully working.
See documentation supplied with GNUCobol.
You MUST have run both sanity checks created by the test procedures including
within the cobol85 suite as well as the make check procedure.

Installation
============

Linux/Unix:
Compile the source of cobxref.cbl and get-reserved-lists.cbl with the
GNUCobol compiler cobc using the supplied shell script comp-cobxref.sh with
the command ./comp-cobxref.sh at a command prompt using any terminal program.

Now place cobxref in a directory that is within the PATH making sure that the
execute flag is set (chmod +x cobxref) although this is done within the script.

Mac OSX:
Compile the Cobol source as for Linux/Unix.

In the event this does not work, you must have installed and tested GNUCobol.
Note this will not work 'as is' with Tiny Cobol or ANY other compiler.

NOTES:
*****

You must compile using an up to date version of GNUCobol (c) but not less
than version 1.1 dated Feb 2009 but will work best using v2.x. Current testing
is with v2.1.

Please also read Cobxref.txt for instructions on using cobxref.
