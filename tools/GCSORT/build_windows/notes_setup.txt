The following was written for using the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler in the
rare circumstances where a GCC build (for example via MinGW) cannot be used.

Most of this applies to other C compilers for Microsoft Windows, too - please
report any issues and working solutions with other compilers.

GCSORT needs support for either `long long` (for WIN32 `__int64` is used),
very old compilers may lack support for this (like Visual C++ 2003 and older).

How to build in native Windows environments:

* get/build Win flex-bison executable
* add to environment variable PATH folder where are presents win_flex.exe and win_bison.exe 
* necessary headers, link libraries and runtime dlls are present in build_windows\win32\gnucobol
  you can upgrade this. Get/build place them in build_windows\Win32\gnucobol and build_windows\x64\gnucobol
* compile with your environment, for example via IDE by opening the solution
  and click "build" or by starting the VS/WinSDK command prompt and calling
  msbuild "gcsort.sln" /p:Platform=win32;Configuration=Release

How to create the dist package:

* set up the above
* compile the release version you want (Win32 and/or x64)
* sign the binaries if needed
* if you want a 7z and have a non-standard installation: change "makedist.bat"
* call "makedist.bat" (uses the last build from Win32\release and x64\release)

How to use the dist package:

* unzip wherever you want
* use gcsort

How to test the native builds:

* if you want to run the tests 
  do the following commands:
  cd $yourfolder
  cd tests
  call compile.bat
  cd ..\bin
  gctestsetup
  gctestrun
