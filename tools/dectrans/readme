			      Dectrans
		http://sourceforge.net/projects/dectrans/


Dectrans is a Cobol Decision Table Translator that reads Decision Tables within
a Cobol source file  and will produce Cobol code based on those tables that can
be input to a Cobol compiler such as GnuCobol running under any of the
operating systems that GnuCobol will run under.

If the tables are embedded within the Procedure Division of a Cobol source
Program they will be converted at the same point in the source code so that the
output file can be input directly to the compiler.

[GNUCobol is an open-source COBOL compiler, which translates COBOL programs to
C code and compiles it using GCC on multiple platforms and operating systems]

All code and programs are distributed under the GNU General Public License.
See COPYING for details.


Requirements
============

GNUCobol package installed and tested working. See documentation supplied with
GNUCobol. You MUST have run the test procedures including the cobol85 suite.

Installation
============

Linux/Unix:
Just place Dectrans in directory of source code to be translated. Making
sure that the execute flag is set (chmod +x dectrans). In the event that the
binary does not work you will need to recompile the Cobol source code.
Of course you can also place the dectrans executable into the ~/bin directory
where it is in your PATH, see below.

Windows/Mac:
Compile the Cobol source see below.

In the event this does not work you must have installed and tested GNUCobol.
Note This should work 'as is' with any other compiler.

To compile with GNUCobol:

Place dectrans files in own directory having moved to same directory.
From terminal program run:

cobc -x dectrans.cbl

This will produce a statically linked executable called dectrans
which you can place in a common directory that is listed in your PATH,
ie., /usr/local/bin [needs root access] or /home/username/bin.
