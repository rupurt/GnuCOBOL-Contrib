PRESQL2
-------

A program to process SQL type syntax to be used with MySQL (or others
via ODBC) for input to the GnuCOBOL compiler along with other support
programs and files.

This package does NOT use EXEC statements but a variation of the theme
as extra commands are injected in to the source pack (see the manual
about syntax for full details).
It is planned to add in direct support for EXEC SQL syntax that will
support both fixed and free source formats (upon request).

The complete documentation about set up and usage can be found in
presql2.pdf.
