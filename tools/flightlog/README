Read the manual FIRST.

Yes, the manual may not be complete or contain errors on both layout
and content.  Please report any you find using the Tracker tool on the
website or use the Forums if you cannot work out how to use it.

Reminders for users to do:
1. Script changes for your usage based on location or ..

A. Copy prtpdf-sh-A4 or prtpdf.sh-Letter to prtpdf.sh depending on
the paper size you use. 

It has been tested using a HP8600 inkjet
using Linux distro's Mageia v6 X64 and Raspberry Pi 3B+ Debian.
Where the Pi has an attached USB 1Tb hard drive linked to / via
/etc/fstab.

Likewise testing for flightlog has been run on the Pi and works exactly
the same as on Mageia v6 platform (an Redhat sourced version).

B. Copy run-flightlog.sh-UK or run-flightlog.sh-USA or run-flightlog.sh-Unix
to run-flightlog.sh depending on your date format, see manual for more
information.

Now modify run-flightlog.sh to your requirements if needed.
Note that this script uses an argument (date with suggested format of
yyyy-mm-dd or yyyymmdd etc) to create the back up archive.
If no argument is provided it will create as is a file called :
backup-.zip.  The script could be changed to test for no argument and if
so force date based on today or even not do a backup. If I remember and
have time I will do this but assume I haven't.


2. The directory Airfields contains a list by 1st 2 chars of the ICAO code
for many countries but by no means all of them.

There is two files from the UK Air Pilot - as a pdf and txt
starting with EG_AD_1_3_en_2018-09-13 (.pdf and .txt).

There is also 2 files for each .PDF file obtained from the web and the
txt file which has been edited removing accented character and unwanted
(OK, by me) excessive text like 'Airfield', 'Airport' with international
replaced by Int'l in some cases and other just removed.

Note many of these include Public Heliports and one's at hospitals.

Just got bored, trying to clean them up when I considered adding them
to the airfield file. Went off that idea :)

Now an option for those that have a need? Is to using their countries
version of these or/and others is to create from them a csv record type
4 (Airfields) and add them into the Airfield file but it is a fair amount
of work when most pilots use but a fraction of the total in use for a
country and therefore just update after flying to a new airfield.

That said,  commercial crew may well want to do this when they get 
on new routes and just add them in one hit - Your choice.


Here is a list of TODO features for the Flightlog program that may or
may not be added subject to user requests along with any reasons why:

There is no reason why it cannot be added to as a new Feature request.

 TODO may be? (outstanding):

  30/09/18            2. Consider a compressed log book report giving full remarks but using:
                     airfield NAME and flight times only one's flown so that the Pn time
                     data would look instead of P1 P2 P3 for day and night etc, be like:
                     depart time arr time Pn hh.mm (day and night) IFR hh.nn Mult hh.nn.
                     If flight duty is split then next line/s would have spaces for
                     date, A/C type, Reg, captain start and end times, from. to and
                     Pn times for other duties, etc. where two entries for same flight
                     should have a start time difference of one minute: you
                     cannot have two or more entries using the same date and start time.
                     Priority LOW. as likely to look like a mess or 'very' wide o/p
                     that is too wide for A4 let alone US letter although printing
                     to 160 cc continuous stationery would work but who has a matrix
                     printer these days. VERY LOW.

  20/10/18            4. Consider using Mysql RDB for all data used on a per pilot
                     basis. Worth doing ?.
                     Would allow for extra statistics using SQL queries but again is
                     this useful ?.
                     If application used as a web based system allows for multi
                     pilots by using one database per pilot by name via a login
                     facility.    Priority LOW / MEDIUM as would require users
                     to install Mysql package, bit ITT for low exp. users.
                     Could consider using Sqlite but err, why ?

  07/11/18            6. Consider using a web browser interface for display
                     and accepting data. Could be linked to (4).
                     THIS IS A HIGH TIME work load though, so unlikely.
                     Priority LOW.

  20/11/18            7. Consider CSV data reformatting from EBCDIC to ASCII if
                     users requests it. Just have to work out how to, so worry about
                     it then.  Priority LOW as users could use x3270 type programs
                     during transfer to PC to convert a file. Just depends on how
                     users get their CSV data file but they could ask company to
                     supply in correct format !.
