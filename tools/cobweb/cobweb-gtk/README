The GNU Cobol functional bindings to GTK+ 3

make
cobcrun cobweb-gtk
./cobweb-gui

Needs GTK+ 3 libraries and VTE for GTK 3.  (libvte2_90)

In the GTKBuilder test, the sample text editor only has (fake) handlers for
Help/About and with File/Save attached to a callback to display the multiline
text buffer. In this initial release, that is true for both the cobweb-gtk self
test and the cobweb-gui sample.

make cobodoc

Builds ROBODoc documentation.  Requires a patched version of ROBODoc 4.99.41 allowing
for dashes in identifiers (breaking cmode for any expressions like c=a-b;)

make periodic

Builds a sample periodic table, raw CALL to GTK+.

make broadway

Will set the environment so these gui applications show up in a browser at local port 8080
