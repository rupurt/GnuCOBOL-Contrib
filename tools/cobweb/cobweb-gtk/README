The GnuCOBOL 2 functional bindings to GTK+ 3
============================================

This is a work in progess.  Licensed under the GNU GPL 3.1 (or later, at your
discretion)

Building cobweb-gtk
-------------------

*Requires GnuCOBOL 2.0 or above as it makes extensive use of FUNCTION-ID*

The included Makefile has a default target of cobweb-gui (an example
application; currently a simple testhead)

make
cobcrun cobweb-gtk
cobcrun cobweb-gtk test
./cobweb-gui

cobweb-gtk, the dynamic library (DSO), includes a entry point suitable for use
with cobcrun. Without arguments, this entry point simply displays a REPOSITORY
paragraph suitable for direct paste into application level COBOL.  With an
argument of "test", "testing" or "check", the library will exercise the various
widget set and display a few windows.

Needs GTK+ 3 libraries and VTE for GTK 3.  (libvte2_90)

In the GTKBuilder test, the sample text editor only has simple handlers for
Help/About, which displays a dialog box, and the File/Save menu item attached
to a callback to display the multiline text buffer. In this initial release,
that is true for both the cobweb-gtk self test and the cobweb-gui sample.

make cobodoc

Builds ROBODoc documentation.  Requires a patched version of ROBODoc 4.99.41
allowing for dashes in identifiers, with --cobol (breaking cmode for any
expressions like c=a-b;)

make periodic

Builds a sample periodic table, raw CALL to GTK+.

make broadway

Will set the environment so these gui applications show up in a browser at local port 8080
