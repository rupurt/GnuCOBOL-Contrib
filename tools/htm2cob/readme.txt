With the HTM2COB tool you can convert an HTML file into a COBOL source
code. The generated COBOL program is a CGI server program. In the HTML input
you can additionally embed COBOL codes with a simple syntax. After generating
the COBOL program, you can immediately compile and install it onto your web
server. For more information please read the HTM2COB PDF documentation.
