Installing the editor (quick and dirty)
---------------------------------------
Compile the editor, the result is pipedit.bin

Copy pipedit.bin to /usr/local/bin which is (hopefully) included in your
$PATH.
su cp pipedit.bin /usr/local/bin

copy pipedit.cfg to your $HOME directory
cp pipedit.cfg $HOME

edit pipedit.cfg in your $HOME directory
set the language to default

language=default

and comment all other language options with ### at the beginning of the line.


Edit the config file for your shell, .bashrc or .kshrc or whatever
and add the following line

PIPEDITCFG=$HOME/pipedit.cfg ; export PIPEDITCFG

Close your current terminal session by typing exit and start a new one, so the
changes from .bashrc will take effect.



Running the editor
------------------
pipedit.bin [filename] [-log]

-log creates a logfile for debugging purposes of the editor
