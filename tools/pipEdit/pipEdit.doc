==============================
   pipEdit is an ISPF lookalike editor meant for COBOL source code.

   original IBM ISPF editor.

   1. Enter - In the line commands it jumps to the next line command,
      column 1. In the text area it jumps to the next line of text to
      the first character found in this line. At the bottom of the
      screen Enter scrolls down one line, if possible.
   2. F3 - Saves the current file and terminates the editor.
   3. F7/Page up - Scroll up the screen, depending on the position of
      the cursor on the screen.

      of the cursor on the screen.
   5. INS - Inserts one blank character at the curent cursor position.

      line.
