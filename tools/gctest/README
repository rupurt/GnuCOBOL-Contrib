gctest is used to invoke the GnuCOBOL compiler, then execute the program
It will capture output from the compiler and program execution to create
an autotest file suitable for inclusion in the GnuCOBOL testsuite.

You have to manually merge in the created program.at file your self.

To compile this run:
  make

To install it run:
  make install

gctest 'usage' display:

GnuCOBOL compile a COBOL program, execute & capture output
to create an autotest.at file named from -p programname
 
  gctest [options]
Where [options] are:
  -p program      The COBOL program to compile and test
  -C mod.c        A C module used by 'program' to compile
  -i inputfile    Define input file for test program
  -o outputfile   Define Output report file
  -O LSoutfile    Define LINE SEQUENIAL output file
  -b              Make test code start with blank line
  -e              test compile only; Expecting errors
  -E              compile only; both std=mf & std=2002; Expecting errors
  -m              use -std=mf instead of -std=cobol2002
  -I              use -std=ibm instead of -std=cobol2002
  -w              Compile with no warnings
  -c "compile command"  
  -k "Test keywords"  
  -s "Test setup name"  
 
Example command:
 gctest -m -b -k report -s "Sample REPORT" -i STUDENT=./student0.inp \
           -o REPORT1=./REPORT0.txt -p rwtst0.bat


Example of usage:
    gctest -m -b -k report -s "Sample REPORT" -i STUDENT=./student0.inp \
           -o REPORT1=./REPORT0.txt -p rwtst0.bat
