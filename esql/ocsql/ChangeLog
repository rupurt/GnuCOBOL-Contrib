	* Fixed extremely heavy bug for EXEC SQL CALL with COMP-3 parameters
    * It's been implemented cordially wrong for DECIMAL
    * It is still the issue for INOUT parameters at least for SQL Server 2012
    * I hope Microsoft resolved that in the latest versions, but I can't confirm.
    * Also fixed BufferSize issue for VARCHAR (both OUTPUT and INOUT).
